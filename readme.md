==============

 I have been incredibly frustrated with most of the themes I've purchased for CMS like Wordpress and Ghost. They look good out of the box, but are usually extremely difficult to update properly. 

 Newsy has a simple and clear set of configurations: it's all based on bootstrap with a clearly documented set of overrides, so you won't need to wade through tons of confusing CSS to customize something, and you'll never break any of the underlying elegance by tweaking some stuff here and there.
